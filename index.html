                    <p style="color:#2F4F4F;">My name is Lily Edmondson and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a senior in Leeds with an emphasis in Marketing
                         and a CTD minor. In my free time I love to hang out with my friends, ski, hike, and go see live music. I am originally from Atlanta, GA, but my family is in the process of moving the Kansas City, MO.
                        In highschool, I was a swimmer and soccer player and was also involved in a wide variety of clubs. I chose to come to CU because of the outdoor activities and my love for skiing.
                        Here at CU I am involved in greek life and am apart of the Boulder Freeride club. Hopefully after graduation I get to stick around in the Denver area (in hopes to never leave!!)

                            and dear to my heart.</a>  </p>
