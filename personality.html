            <h2>About the Hartmans Personality Test</h2>
            <p>On the outside, this test is rather simplistic. 
            A person will have to endure a 45 question exam that asks them a plethora of different questions. 
            Once the test has been completed, the corresponding answers will dictate what color code a person is.
             This may seem simplistic, but it is a fantastic way to determine a persons personality.</p>

            <h3>Personality Color Descriptions</h3>

                <h4>Yellow Brings the Fun</h4>
                    <p>The fun, happy people in life are perceived as the color yellow. 
                    These individuals are always positive and ready for what life brings them. 
                    A spontaneous nature ensures that yellows are able to take full advantage of life and meet new friends.
                    This is also ideal for yellows because they develop friends with ease, but 
                    are often too preoccupied with themselves to hold lasting friendships or relationships.</p>

                <h4>Blues Want Goodness</h4>
                    <p>Blues are the people that we like to surround ourselves with. 
                    The blue personality is those that rely on relationships and will do anything for a friend. Personal gains are truly not important to this personality and they are often deemed as perfectionists.
                    This color worries, loves immensely and strives for the cultural roots of their heritage. 
                    However, for all the good they do, this group is insecure and oftentimes controlling. They do not trust others easily and never forget.</p>

                <h4>White is Peaceful</h4>
                    <p>The color white always brings peace to a persons mind and this is the same for this personality. 
                        Whites are patient and kind. These are the friends that every person desires. They are thoughtful, considerate and are not judgmental. 
                        They will listen for hours and not want anything in return but to be a good friend. 
                        These individuals will fall victim to their own internal struggles as they like to stay quiet. They do not want to work for someone else and are often not happy with their accomplishments.</p>

                <h4>Reds Love Power</h4>
                    <p>Those with the red color like power. This personality is given to a person that is very assertive and will be the leader of the group. Through their discipline and management skills, they are often very successful.
                     However, this also leads right into their negative aspects. Reds need to be right and are often far too critical of others.
                    This does not mean that they are inherently mean, but they simply cannot ignore what they are thinking. They are controllers and like to be right and dominate.</p>
